1. Count the total number of months included in the dataset.

2. Net total over entire period: perhaps just sum total?

3. Average of the changes in profit/loss over the entire period: 

4. Largest increase in profit (date and amount) over entire period:

5. Greatest decrease in losses?? (data and amount) over the entire period.


1. Perhaps just the array.length?

2. Update a var with each element's money value for every element in the array.

3. Store all of the changes, sum all of the changes, divide the sum by the number of entries/indices

4. Biggest delta increase?

5. Biggest delta decrease?


negative test: if 1st value is negative (-7), and 2nd value is positive (+10), we want the result to be 7 + 10 = 17.

****

log the DIFFERENCE between each month in a new array
divide the total sum of the differences above by the number of months for the average difference
